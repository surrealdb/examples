# SurrealDB x OpenAI: A Chat Playground

Hey there! You've just stumbled upon a cool little project that's all about mashing up the brilliance of OpenAI with the database wizardry of SurrealDB. Think of this as a sandbox where we're diving deep into the realms of Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG) by mixing up a large dataset of Wikipedia articles with some fancy vector storage and search capabilities.

## So, What's the Big Idea?

We're on a mission to explore the frontiers of what's possible when you pair up SurrealDB with OpenAI. We're talking about importing a whopping 25k Wikipedia articles, complete with their vectors (thanks to OpenAI's smarts), and then whipping up a RAG question-answering system that's as cool as it sounds.

We've got a cozy little FastAPI server acting as our backstage crew, Jinja2 spinning up the templates, and htmx making our frontend chat application as lively as a chat at your favorite coffee shop.

## Gear Up

Before diving in, here's what we're playing with:

- A shiny Apple M2 Pro running MacOS Sonoma 14.4
- SurrealDB 1.3.0, cozied up on disk
- Python 3.11, because we like to keep things fresh

Hit a snag? Just holler, and we'll sort it out together.

## Getting the Party Started

First off, make sure SurrealDB is ready to rock on your machine (check out [how to get it up and running](https://surrealdb.com/install)). For Python 3.11, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is your best buddy.

Grab this repo with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ce11an/surrealdb-openai.git
```

You're gonna need an OpenAI API key for this shindig. Not sure where to snag one? Peek at the [OpenAI Developer Quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart). Now, because SurrealDB and environment variables are currently in a complicated relationship, we've got a nifty workaround in [chats.surql](https://github.com/Ce11an/surrealdb-openai/blob/main/schema/chats.surql) for you to slip your OpenAI API key into:

```sql
DEFINE FUNCTION IF NOT EXISTS fn::get_openai_token() {
    RETURN "Bearer <your-secret-key-here>"
};
```

*Heads up:* This is all for kicks and not meant for the production grind. Keep your OpenAI API key under wraps!

### Setting Up SurrealDB

With your setup ready, hit up some `make` commands to get SurrealDB into gear:

Fire up SurrealDB for some on-disk action:

```bash
make surreal-start
```

To lay down the database blueprint with table and function definitions:

```bash
make surreal-init
```

Need a clean slate? Here's how to clear your database:

```bash
make surreal-remove
```

### Python Time

Jump into the Python virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Get all the project goodies installed:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Grabbing the Dataset

We're going for the Simple English Wikipedia dataset by OpenAI (it's a biggie â€” ~700MB zipped, sprawling into a 1.7GB CSV file) that includes those nifty vector embeddings. Ready to download it?

```bash
get-data
```

### Populating SurrealDB

Time to move that dataset into SurrealDB:

```bash
surreal-insert
```

### Let's Do Some RAG!

Dive into SurrealDB with SurrealQL:

```bash
make surreal-sql
```

And here's a taste of what you can do with a RAG operation:

```sql
RETURN fn::surreal_rag("gpt-3.5-turbo", "Who is the greatest basketball player of all time?", 0.85, 0.5);
```

### Let's chat?

To start chatting with the RAG:

```
make server-start
```

## Extra Bits

Beyond the RAG adventure, feel free to query, explore, and play with the data in any way you fancy. And if you're looking to amp up your game, tools like LangChain are there to spice things up.

## Features! More features!

- [ ] Handle them darn errors! Reply with a system message that informs the user there has been an oopsie.
- [ ] Add user chat history as context.
- [ ] There are way too many steps to get started - docker-compose?
- [ ] Perform RAG to generate SurrealQL QA - this I will need help with.
- [ ] Ummm where are the tests? You, the user, are the test! (seriously, I need to add some...).

## Coffee, Anyone?
