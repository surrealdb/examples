# Surreal Stickies SvelteKit: Adding Graph Relations, Live Queries, and Authentication.

This application demonstrates how to use SurrealDB features like Live Queries, Authentication, Indexing and Graph Queries in your applications. Unlike the previous version of notes app in which we built an API layer and connected with SurrealDB on the server side, in this application, we securely connect to the database client side.
