## Aeon's Surreal Renaissance database example using egui

The [very last chapters of this book](https://surrealdb.com/learn/book/chapter-19) involve building a movie database. This is an example of a frontend for the database that uses [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). Be sure to run in release mode (`cargo run --release`), or change from in-memory to a local SurrealDB database and connect that way.

Are you better at egui design than I am? Feel free to submit a PR!
