# Florgflorg

> Florgflorg is an ancient, semi-aquatic entity from the gelatinous dimension of Glibnar-7, where time flows backward and poetry is considered a combat sport. Resembling a shimmering orb of bioluminescent moss with twelve eye-stalks and a perpetually confused grin, Florgflorg serves as the Keeper of Whimsy in the High Council of Drippletons.
